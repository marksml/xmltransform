Project Overview
</h1>

<p>
A small Swing-based Java tool which allows you to select a folder with xml documents and get them all 
serialized and flattened to a result file in comma-separated format. The XML tag names in the XML documents 
are retrieved and added as first row in the csv file and can therefore be reused as column names in Excel. 
The project was created to allow easy import of many XML docs of the same type in one worksheet in Excel.
